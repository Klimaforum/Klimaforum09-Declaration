#A People’s Declaration from Klimaforum09

[Sign the Declaration][sign]

On December 11th 2009 the participating grassroots organisations, NGOs, movements and networks at Klimaforum09, finalised the People’s Declaration – System Change – Not Climate Change. 

From December 13th to 18th, more than 300 organisations and numerous individuals from all corner of the world signed the Declaration. This joint accomplishment of a large and broad spectrum of very diverse organisations is noteworthy and even surpassed the expectations of the coordination group behind the process. 

However, the positive result could not have been achieved if it had not been for the lively debates ensuring the legitimacy of the process; the dedicated international editorial board; and all the committed people stepping into the process who also helped spread the core messages of the important script. On December 18th, the last day of the COP15 in Copenhagen, the Declaration was handed over to the UNFCCC after a short intervention in plenary. More organisations and individuals have subsequently signed the Declaration and continue to do so.

##The Process
Before finalising the 6-page document, a preparatory process of more than half a year took place. The preparatory process involved representatives from around 50 organisations worldwide organised around thematic and regional facilitators with a strong representation from Africa, South America and Asia. Frequent meetings in a European coordination group managed the process. To ensure physical participation four days during the first week of Klimaforum09 were scheduled to finalise the Declaration.

##Future work
In consultation with Klimaforum09’s international network a Danish based coordination group continue to work on how to use the Declaration in future work locally, nationally and globally. Of high priority is a handover of the Declaration to the Mexican organisers of Klimaforum10 parallel to COP16 in Cancun.
